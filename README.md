# Awesome Unfinished [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)  


>A curated list of awesome but forever unfinished works and projects. 


Unfinished refers to any awesome work or project that can be consumed but can _**never**_ be completed.   This can refer to a TV show, a book series, a symphony, a video game, or any other substantial effort that was at least partially avaiable to the public or community but all further work has been halted permanently.  

Unfinished is *not* any work or project that is still in development, has activity upstream or downstream, is related to a book series where the author is still alive, or any other situation where the possibility for that work or project to resume activity in its current state still exists.  

If you are unsure if something is actually unfinished just submit an [issue](https://github.com/Zorziel/awesome-unfinished/issues) and we'll help investigate!
